// TODO :::
- for the setTopRight function (and other associated position functions) add an inside or outside parameter which will
    allow the programmer to set their symbol either inside or outside of the frame
- doctor up the cli.js file
- make the app able to handle symbols that the programmer generates. Perhaps add some canned symbols (ascii art)
-- for this the program has to be able to handle ascii art! modifications in the Symbol class
